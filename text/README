Code Organization
-----------------

Extract the .zip file on your computer.  It will contain one directory, "LAWAOpenText-2021A-LyryxLearning". Inside this directory are three sub-directories:
"text": All content is in this directory.
"styles": Style files required for the content.
"scripts": Contains two scripts required to run the makefile properly.  

Inside "text":

The top-level Latex file is "Nicholson-LAWA.tex".  This file lists all
of the required packages and imports the files "content.tex" that define the content to be included in the textbook.



Customizing the Textbook
------------------------

To customize the text for your course:

1: Edit frontmatter/courseInfo.txt

  This file contains specific course and institution information to be
  displayed on title page.

2: Edit content.tex

  This file imports the chapter and section files that will define the content
  of the textbook.  Chapters and sections can be reorded in this file or
  removed.


Compiling
---------

This textbook is designed to be compiled using TeX Live 2015 but other
versions may work as well.  TeX Live can be downloaded from
https://www.tug.org/texlive/ .  You will need to look through their archive
to find older versions of the compiler.


On Linux: Add TeX Live 2015 to the PATH in your environment or edit the PATH
  defined in the Makefile.  Then run one of the commands below.

On Windows: Install the Cygwin command-line environment from
  https://www.cygwin.com/ and add TeX Live 2015 to the PATH in Cygwin.  Then
  run one of the commands below.  Alternatively, you can use one of the many
  Latex editors or the built-in Windows command-line and simply run TeX Live
  directly.

The Makefile:

This is provided for convenience to compile the textbook.  It invokes the
typical "latex, dvips, ps2pdf" chain of commands.  We use the "--jobname"
argument to latex to compile variations on the textbook such as for
print-on-demand services.

Run "make" to compile the main textbook, including cover page and solutions.

Run "make clean" to clean directory and remove unnecessary files after compiling. 

Note that some files are inputted as a PDF; the front/back covers, some front matter. The final compiled file is entitled "LinearAlgebraWithApplications_2021A.pdf".
